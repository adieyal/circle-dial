        This is an experimental data visualisation that represents barcharts inside of a dial which can spin. It is a work in progress. The red circles represent the data points. The closer to the centre, the higher the value. The lines in between them are meaningless and are created using a quadratic bezier curve. The curves will look different when the visualisation is complete.
